# 🌳 Decision Tree Classification – Internship Task 1

## 📌 Task Objective:

As part of my internship, the goal of this task was to **build and visualize a Decision Tree Classification model** using **Scikit-learn** on a dataset of my choice.

For this project, I used the famous **Iris dataset**, which contains information about different species of Iris flowers based on their features.

## 📂 Project Description:

✅ Loaded the **Iris dataset** using `sklearn.datasets`  
✅ Explored and understood the dataset structure (features and target labels)  
✅ Split the data into **training** and **testing** sets  
✅ Built a **Decision Tree Classifier** using `DecisionTreeClassifier` from Scikit-learn  
✅ Trained the model on training data  
✅ Evaluated the model accuracy on test data  
✅ Visualized the complete **Decision Tree** using `plot_tree` from Matplotlib

## 🧱 Project Workflow:

1. **Data Loading:**  
   Imported the Iris dataset using Scikit-learn.

2. **Data Exploration:**  
   - Viewed feature names, target names, and dataset shape.
   - Checked sample data points.

3. **Data Splitting:**  
   Divided the dataset into **training** and **test** sets (using `train_test_split`).

4. **Model Building:**  
   Trained a **Decision Tree Classifier** on the training data.

5. **Model Evaluation:**  
   Calculated **accuracy** on test data using `accuracy_score`.

6. **Visualization:**  
   Plotted the **Decision Tree graphically** using `plot_tree()`.
